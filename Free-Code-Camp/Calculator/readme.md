# Calculator Project
 
In this project, we will try to reverse engineer the standard Windows calculator app and make a simplified version of it. 


## Challenges

* use Bootstrap to organize the layout of the calculator and jQuery to make interactions with the DOM
* use ',' as a separator of the integral part and the fractional part of the numbers instead of '.'
* use CSS to stylize the calculator
* find out the calculator logic and implement it in javascript
