# Markdown Previewer Project

In this project, we will implement a markdown previewer.

## What we will be able to do ?
* Write the markdown in the editor screen and check the preview in the other screen.
* Zoom In/ Out the screens.

### Challenges
* Use React to implement the site, figuring out in which components we will divide the program. 
* Use SCSS to implement the style of the site.

### Notes
* Used [Marked.js Libary](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to parse the markdown.
* Used [Font Awesome Library](https://fontawesome.com) to get icons: FreeCodeCamp icon, zoom windows icons.
