# Week Plans Project

In this project, we will build a to-do list in order to help the organization of the week.

## What will we be able to do ?

* There will be a board with the days of the week
* Add an action in the week on the board
* Display one column for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...)
* Drag the actions between the days of the week
* Remove actions  
* Add priorities (e.g., color alert)
* Be able to get a print of the screen and download/share the print 


### Challenges

* Use just Javascript to develop the logic of the program and the dom manipulation (i.e., no frameworks, jquery ...)
* Use just CSS to develop the style of the program (i.e., no Bootstrap)
