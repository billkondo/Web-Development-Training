# Calculator Project
 
In this project, we will try to reverse engineer the standard Windows calculator app and make a simplified version of it. 

## What will we be able to do ?

* Do the elementary operations: addtion, subtraction, multiplication and division
* Click on the buttons
* Use keypresses to activate the buttons
* Keep chaining mathematical operations together until the enter key is pressed/clicked
* Add decimals into the number
* Change signal of the input field
* Clear input field with a clear button

## Challenges

* Use Bootstrap to organize the layout of the calculator and jQuery to make interactions with the DOM
* Use ',' as a separator of the integral part and the fractional part of the numbers instead of '.'
* Use CSS to stylize the calculator
* Find out the calculator logic and implement it in javascript

### Notes

* AC: button that resets the calculator
* CE: button that clear the input field
* +-: button that changes the signal of the input field
* <=: a correction button. Got the symbol with help of font awesome
